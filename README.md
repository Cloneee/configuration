# Configuration

**CunnyDevâ€™s Pulumi configuration** to automate the invitation of new members to the organization.

## Joining our Organization

- Edit `index.ts` and add your name to `cunnier`, sort it alphabetically.
- Once PR is merged, accept invitation within 7 days. If you cannot find your invitation, contact gusbell@cunny.dev
- Once you are in the organization, please **set your visibility to public**, activate 2FA and set your geolocation. (If you are Thai, set this to Thailand so we can climb up in commits.top)
